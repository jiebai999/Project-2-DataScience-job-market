![Data Science](Images/data-science-ultimate-guide-infographic.png)
In this project, we will build an user-driven interactive dashboard to explore the [Data Scientist Job Market in the US](https://www.kaggle.com/sl6149/data-scientist-job-market-in-the-us).
We will also use the [Indeed Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/elroyggj/indeed-dataset-data-scientistanalystengineer#indeed_job_dataset.csv), as well as the [Data-Professional-Salary-Survey](https://data.world/finance/data-professional-salary-survey)
If possible, we also would like to incorporate the data from indeed api (https://opensource.indeedeng.io/api-documentation/).

  To help people (including me) to better understand the data science job market, we will build a user driven dashboard to What kind of talent do employers want when they are hiring a data scientist; 
  Which locations in the nation have the most opportunities; The data professional salary change from year 2015 to 2018; And the job demand increase from year 2015 to 2018. 
  D3, Javascript, Leaflet or Plotly, and Tableau might be used to realize the user friendly dashboard.
